1. extracted whole feature set for each time point, ( FAMD_R_code:facotered analysis for mixed data ) 
   For continuous features,  Minus the mean and Divide the standard deviation (SD), which is given in 'continuous.features.mean&sd.csv',
   There are total 100 continuous features.
   For discrete features, find the corresponding eigenvectors in the 'discrete.eigenvector.csv'

2. Multiple the standardized feature values with eigenvectors (both continuous and discrete features), only select the 1-30 columns in the eigenvector.csv, then we can transfer the original feature value into a smaller space with 30 dimensions.

3. Calculate the emission probability based on mu, sigma files and Current Action.
   for mu.txt files, there are 30 rows, each of which indicates one dimension and 5 hidden states.
   for sigma,txt files, each line is a diagnal matrix, containing 30 elements.
   You can use miltivariate Gaussian PDF to calculate the probability given 30 dimensions, OR
   You can use sigle-variage Gaussian PDF to calculate the probability of one dimensions, then multiple the 30 probabilities.

4. Calculate alpha_t (forward) at current time step t,
   alpha_t(z=j) = P(Y_{t} | z=j) * \sum_{i=1}^{K} alpha_{t-1}(z=i)*A(z_{t-1}=i, z_{t}=j)

5. Normalize alpha_t, which is a vector containing 5 elements (cause we have 5 hidden states)
   the normalized alpha_t is the hidden state distribution at time step t.

6. Based on 'single_state_QFun.txt', we can calculate the Q function of the hidden state distribution for each action.

7. For deterministic policy, we can just choose the action asociated with the maximum value of Q function as the current optimal choice.
   For Stochastic policy, we need to transfer Q function into probability by use softmax function with theta, which is 0.04,  then we can do the same thing as we did for MDP stochastic policy,
